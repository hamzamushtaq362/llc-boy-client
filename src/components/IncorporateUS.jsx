              Forming a company in the US is viewed as more trustworthy by
              financial service providers, like Stripe, PayPal, and banks due to
              the nationâ€™s established business infrastructure and stringent
              regulatory environment.

              A US-based company provides a legal separation between a business
              and its owners, known as limited liability protection. This means
              that in the event of lawsuits or debts, personal assets of the
              owners are generally protected.

              A US company can lend prestige and credibility to a business. The
              US is often seen as a leader in innovation and entrepreneurship,
              and having a US-based company can enhance the reputation of a
              business both domestically and internationally.
